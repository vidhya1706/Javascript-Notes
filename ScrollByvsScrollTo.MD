# scrollTo()

- The scrollTo(x,y) method scrolls the document to specified coordinates.

x - The coordinate to scroll to horizontally in pixels.
y - The coordinate to scroll to vertically in pixels.

# scrollBy()

- The scrollBy(x,y) method scrolls the document by the specified number of pixels.

x - Number of pixels to scroll horizontally. Positive values scroll to the right, negative values to the left.
y - Number of pixels to scroll vertically. Positive values scroll down, negative values scroll up.

For both scrollBy() and scrollTo() method to work, the document must be larger than the screen, and the scrollbar must be visible.
