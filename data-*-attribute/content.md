HTML5 custom data-\* attributes ðŸ’¡

ðŸ”º Data attributes are one of the more powerful additions in HTML 5 and the main purpose of a data attribute is to store extra information on semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as non-standard attributes like class, id, etc.
ðŸ”º The information stored might not be essential for readers but it would be helpful for developers.
ðŸ”º It is a hook that helps our HTML to communicate with our CSS and JavaScript.

ðŸ”´ Its syntax has some rules

1. The attribute name should not contain any uppercase letters, and must be at least one character long after the prefix "data-"

2. The attribute value can be any string.
